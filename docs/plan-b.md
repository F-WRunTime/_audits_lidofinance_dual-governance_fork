# Single governance specification (plan B)

Signle Governance (SG) is a governance subsystem that sits between the Lido DAO, represented by various voting systems, and the protocol contracts it manages. It protects protocol users from hostile actions by the DAO by allowing to cooperate and block any in-scope governance decision until either the DAO cancels this decision or users' (w)stETH is completely withdrawn to ETH.
